Current Issues:
Quick commands seem to affect drones
Zoniqs weapon placements need reviewing

Docking a carrier doesn't remove it's drones - not a big deal, you paid for them, you can directly control them.
Kreal Capital ships dont have abilities - fixed?
Some kind of bug unable to launch ships from base - not a bug, normal ships cost money, default = 50% of health

Next Ideas:
Unique audio for races

Tournament: 
Group stages, winners & losers bracket - include spectating??!
Save progress & resume
Choose a faction & race to play
Tracking stats: number of tournaments played, wins, losses, highest place, total points, overal ranking
