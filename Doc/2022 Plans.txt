Allegiance Forms.
The original goal from 2017: a fun commander AI so we can have an immersive space battle with few players.
This game is pretty fun and could do with a bit more work...
Redeveloping in 3D should be the long-term plan...

Next Steps:
 - Ship Abilities
 - Finish voice command orders
 - Revamp random maps, the "room layout" style or just simple mirrored positions
 - Add Multiplayer!

Wild Ideas: 
 - Add a Button "Scenarios":
   Choose fun game presets with a preset state (4 team brawl, coop team, defend a large empire against multiple small teams, overcome a large empire, etc)
   Intro story & backgorund image (could become a basic "Campaign")

 - Add a "Commander League" to progress through, battling other AI commanders, rating, seasonal tournaments to participate in etc

 - Add a Button "Pilot Missions":
   Top down Shooter with space ships and effects, same maps, same Commander AI, better combat & controls
   Launch whatever ship you can, engage the enemy and win the war!
   Add an "Experience" system, tracking kills, earning credits completing missions, unlocking control upgrades, special weapons/shields
   
 - "Bullet Hell" rogue-like shooter
   Add more projectiles & shooting patterns
   WASD & Mouse aim
   Use Random Abilities & maps, hire allies, gather equipment and materials
   Might need Graphics Update (SharpDX? MonoGame?)

 - Add a button "Open Galaxy" Random Galaxy Map, systems, caves & tunnels. Faction controlled, fly around, join or command conflicts, gather things, trade, upgrade ship

 - Immersive galaxy for stories and roleplay
   Multiplayer, jobs, campanies, income, crimes, freedom, voice coms "GTA5 in SPACE"
   Other game modes are "simulations / training / wargames / sport"
   Pirates, Traders, Police, Army, Medics, Factions, esport teams, gathering
   Police stations, jail, hospitals, libraries, banks, warehouses, shops, garages, workshops, player housing
   Random galaxy, factions to join/fight, abilities to learn, gear to find/craft
   Minigames for picking, hacking etc.
   AI pirates, traders, police, medics, army
   Character-driven & voice acted
   Probably ok to have random cities and layouts
   Need to have teleport for fast emergency response
   (limited use, restricted tech)
   Your ship remains when you logout, park it at a space station/port
