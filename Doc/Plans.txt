Allegiance Forms: Future?

Gameplay
Interesting, easier AI with more end game variations
Story Campaign, with player choice impact, plot twists, scripted in-game events. Novel-like telling. Voice acted with artistic portraits & backgrounds.
Better graphics, particle effects, sounds.
Better UI: more notifications, shortcut buttons, mini map.

Balance
Capital ships not requiring pilots - allows an economy to win easily. Too cheap & quick... Too much starting money?

Simpler/Variant AI
2 missions at a time, group ships up
always build refineries if have He3 rocks
1 tech at a time (50% home tech, 50% next door), fully upgrade in order.
bombers, next tech.
50% chance at SY, group 4+ caps


Neutral ships/bases/space monsters?
Destroyed bases leave salvage?
